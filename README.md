# Project Documentation
Project: A heart disease classifier
Learning goals:
- Learn how to clean data
- Learn the basics of setting up, training, and testing a neural network
Data used: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease
## Project reflection
I created this project by following a neural network creation tutorial found on freeCodeCamp() which can be found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-neural-network-from-scratch/. I then used publically available heart disease data linked above to train and test the neural network I created. This project was made easy by following tutorials but showed me how to use the nueral network theory I learned my undergraduate AI class. My favorite part was learning more about backpropigation, and one challenge I was faced was confusion regarding how data should be split.
## AI usage summary
I used chatGPT to ask me leading questions to guide my learning. I had consulted it for an intial outline of steps and guidance shaping the data. This project conatins modified code that was generated by chatGPT and I do not claim the code as my own.
