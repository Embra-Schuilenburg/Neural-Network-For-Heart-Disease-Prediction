# Project Documentation
Project: A heart disease classifier

Learning goals:
- Learn how to clean data
- Learn the basics of setting up, training, and testing a neural network

Data used: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease
## Project reflection
I created this project by following a neural network creation tutorial found on freeCodeCamp() which can be found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-neural-network-from-scratch/. I then used publically available heart disease data linked above to train and test the neural network I created. This project was made easy by following tutorials but showed me how to use the nueral network theory I learned my undergraduate AI class. My favorite part was learning more about backpropagation, and some challenges I faced were:
1. confusion regarding how data should be split
2. errors regarding labeling in the backpropagation function
## Model iterations
First:
- 1 hidden layer with 6 units
- learning rate: .01
- 10000 epochs
- test accuracy: 88.33%

## Best model and interpretation of results
After experimenting for a while I found the model which I feel achieves the best results. 

Optimal parameters:
- 1 hidden layer with 2 units
- learning rate: .01
- 6000 epochs

Results:
Test data classification accuracy: 91.67%

## AI usage summary
I used chatGPT to ask me leading questions to guide my learning. I had consulted it for an intial outline of steps and guidance shaping the data. This project conatins modified code that was generated by chatGPT and I do not claim the code of this project as entirely my own. Furthermore I used chatGPT to suggest causes of error while debuging and used some of its recommended code to fix the errors. While I used chatGPT a bit more heavily than I would like to usually, the goal of this project was to learn and practice using knowledge from my courses in a real scenario. I'm happy with my behavior and results and feel I have completed those goals.
